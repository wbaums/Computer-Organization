1)
In general, for an array declared as: 
    T D[R][C]
array element D[i][j] is at memory address:
    &D[i][j] = Xd + L(C * i + j)
where L is the size of data type T in bytes
We can extend this equation to work for a 3 dimensional array as well.
This equation become &D[i][j][k] = Xd + L(STi + Tj + k) for an array declared
as T D[R][S][T]. 
Xd is the starting position as before. the j dimension is multiplied by the
S and T arrays because you must traverse every element of an S and T array to
traverse one position in the R array. Similarly, the j position gets multiplied
by T and then you traverse k elements in the 3rd array. Then, the i, j, and k
terms must be multiplied by L, the size an individual element in the array.
This yields the final equatino: Xd + L(STi + Tj + k).
