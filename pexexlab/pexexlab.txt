Gathering Traces:

I begin by running a command to see how emacs can multiply numbers with shell commands:
  $ emacs -Q -batch -eval '(print (* 1250284240 -1844255039))'
Which prints:
2305843008625102544

Next I test the executable:
     $ ~eggert/bin64/bin/emacs-26.3 -Q -batch -eval '(print (* 1250284240 -1844255039))'
which prints:
2305843008625102544

Now I begin generating the commands that will run.
I start by copying and pasting the bash script commands on Piazza into gen-commands.sh.
Then I make gen-commands.sh executable and run it, piping the output into
a text file.
     $ chmod u+x gen-commands.sh     
     $ ./gen-commands.sh > gdb-commands.txt
It looks like this:
set pagination off
break Ftimes
set style enabled off
run -Q -batch -eval '(print (* 1250284240 -1844255039))'
set logging on
set disassemble-next-line on
stepi
stepi
stepi
....

Now I need to figure out exaclty how to step through the function using gdb.
    $ gdb ~eggert/bin64/bin/emacs-26.3
I manually step the Ftimes function of data.c and figure out that I need to use stepi 90 times
to complete the function. I open the file gen-commands.sh and delete the lines creating the
step and next instructions. I replace the loops with one loop stepping 90 times:

for i in {1..90}
do
	echo "stepi"
done

Now I remake the file gdb-commands.txt and reformat the gdb output:

    $ ./gen-commands.sh > gdb-commands.txt
    $ grep "=>.*" gdb.txt |sed "s/=> 0x[0]*\(.*\)/\1/p" | sed "s/\([0-9abcdef]\)\s<[^>]*>:\s\(
    [0-9abcdef ]*\)\s\([^\t]*\)/\1\t\2\t\3/p" > gdb-formatted.txt
Now I create the trace:
    $ uniq gdb-formatted.txt | sed 's/  */ /g' > trace.tr
The trace is complete except for the fourth column. So, I use gdb to manually step
through the function and record the changes in registers and memory. I use the graphical
interface (gdb) "layout next" which shows me the value of each register and how they change after each
assembly line. I use the (gdb) stepi command as well as (gdb) x $register to get values as
needed.

Integer Overflow Handling:

I copy the function into a file testov.c. Then I compile the file with each of the following
commands in order to understand the differences in compilation.
$ gcc -O2 -S testovf.c
$ gcc -O2 -fwrapv -S testovf.c
$ gcc -O2 -fsanitize=undefined -S testovf.c
Then I write a discription about what each compilation tag does in the file testovf.txt
