I begin by copying and pasting the patch in the spec into a new file,
sthttpd.patch.
Then I get and unzip the tar file to which the patch applies:
     $ http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter20/cs33/lab/sthttpd-2.27.0.tar.gz
     $ tar -xvf sthttpd-2.27.0.tar.gz
patching file sthttpd-2.27.0/src/thttpd.c
patching file sthttpd-2.27.0/src/libhttpd.c
patch unexpectedly ends in middle of line
Hunk #1 succeeded at 4078 with fuzz 2.

Then I check my gcc version to make sure that it is the correct one:
     $ which gcc
/usr/local/cs/bin/gcc
which shows me that I am using the correct version.

Now I build it with the patch applied using the the command given in the spec:
    $ ./configure \ LDFLAGS="-Xlinker --rpath=/usr/local/cs/gcc-$(gcc -dumpversion)/lib"
